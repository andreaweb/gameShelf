GAME SHELF (unfinished)

Project built to practice Angular rating, ranking and search skills.

It displays a bunch of games I enjoyed, their review (text and stars) and some tech information (which console, year of release, etc). You'll notice I'm usually a bit late! :D

This project is unfinished. I'll update the issues list soon.

A HEADS-UP ABOUT MY GITHUB ACCOUNT

Since at my job I use a different github account, I currently find more practical to start and update personal projects at my CodePen ( http://codepen.io/andreaweb/ ). I will deff commit more and more in this github account, but for the moment it'll happen mostly at weekends and the occasional holiday. It'll happen EVERY weekend though!

I also wanna be more active in the community and collaborate in other projects. If you think I can be useful, please e-mail me at return.santana@gmail.com

Thanks!
